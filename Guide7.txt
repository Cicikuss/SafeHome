<h1>How to Prepare a Disaster and Emergency Bag?</h1>
<p>In the first 72 hours after the earthquake, a Disaster and Emergency Bag in which you can store your urgent needs and valuable documents until the aid teams arrive can save the lives of you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>It is important to have a Disaster and Emergency Bag ready and within reach, containing the materials you may need immediately after a disaster.&nbsp;The bag should also include the necessary needs for the person(s) you are responsible for (babies, elderly, disabled) and your pets, if any.</p>
<p>After a disaster, you may not be able to reach places where you can get food, drinks and emergency needs.&nbsp;If you have minor injuries, you can repair them yourself.&nbsp;For such situations, it is very important to correctly determine what should be in your disaster kit and keep your bag in a place you can easily reach.&nbsp;Disaster and Emergency Bag should be not only in your home or workplace, but also in your school and classroom.</p>
<p>To do this, you should determine the things you may need with your teacher and keep your bag in your classroom where your teacher can easily reach it.&nbsp;You should not forget the items you need to include in your bag regarding the special needs of disabled individuals.&nbsp;You should check your food and drinks regularly and learn from your elders how to store them without spoiling.</p>
