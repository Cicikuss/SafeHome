<h1>Do You Know the Precautions You Can Take Before, During and After an Earthquake?</h1>
<h3>PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Settlement areas should be determined meticulously.&nbsp;Slippery and plain areas should not be opened to settlement.&nbsp;Housing should not be built on sloping lands with loose soil.</li>
<li>Buildings should be built resistant to earthquake effects.&nbsp;(In accordance with Construction Techniques and Construction Regulations)</li>
<li>Houses and buildings should not be built in places other than those allocated for housing in the zoning plan.</li>
<li>Buildings should not be built near steep cliffs, steep gorges and valleys.</li>
<li>Buildings should not be built on slopes where it snows a lot and where avalanches occur.</li>
<li>The durability of existing buildings should be increased.</li>
<li>Earthquake insurance should be obtained for residences.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these precautions, we should take the following precautions when placing our daily used items in the house in order to be protected from non-structural damage, that is, damage caused by items rather than the building:</p>
<ul>
<li>Items and office supplies placed on the cabinet should be fixed with plastic holder materials or adhesives to prevent them from slipping and falling.</li>
<li>Stoves and other heaters should be fixed to the wall or floor with sturdy materials.</li>
<li>Cabinets and similar items that may tip over should be fixed to each other and to the wall.&nbsp;If there is a gap between the fixed item and the wall, a filling material should be placed in between to reduce the impact effect.</li>
<li>Chandeliers, air conditioners, etc. hanging on the ceiling and wall.&nbsp;Devices should be hung with hooks, far enough away from walls and windows to support their weight.</li>
<li>Cabinet doors containing heavy items should be kept tightly closed by installing mechanical locks.</li>
<li>White goods on the counter that may slide should be prevented from slipping by placing a metal profile under them.</li>
<li>Poisonous, explosive and flammable materials should be fixed in a position where they cannot fall and should be stored in a way that cannot be broken.&nbsp;Phosphorescent, identifying labels should be placed on these items.</li>
<li>Elastic band or wire can be added to the front of the shelves.&nbsp;Small objects and bottles should be placed inside the boxes so that they do not hit each other or topple over.</li>
<li>Gas valves and electrical fuses should be automated against gas leakage and fire.</li>
<li>Dangers on the routes to be used to exit the building urgently should be eliminated, these routes should be marked, and items that may obstruct the exit should be removed from the exit route.</li>
<li>Wide exit routes should be created.&nbsp;Doors that open outward should be used, and emergency exit doors should not be locked.&nbsp;Emergency exits should be illuminated.</li>
<li>Beds should not be placed next to windows or heavy cabinets that may topple over, and there should not be a shelf with heavy items on the bed.</li>
<li>"Disaster preparedness plans" should be made with the participation of all individuals (at home, at work, in an apartment, at school), and this plan should be reviewed every six months.&nbsp;Exercises on how to act according to this plan should be carried out from time to time.</li>
<li>In cases where home cannot be reached in case of a disaster or emergency, how to communicate with family members, alternative meeting places and an out-of-region contact person that individuals can reach (inside the home, workplace, school, or outside the neighborhood) should be determined.</li>
<li>Copies of important documents (identity cards, title deed, insurance documents, health certificate, diplomas, passport, bank book, etc.) should be prepared and stored in a waterproof manner, and a copy of these documents should be kept with the out-of-region contact person.</li>
<li>Appropriate fire extinguishing devices must be available and periodically maintained according to the characteristics and size of the residence or workplace, as determined by the building management.&nbsp;These devices;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It should be kept in an easily accessible place.</li>
<li>Its location should be known to everyone.</li>
<li>It must be fixed firmly to the wall.</li>
<li>It must be maintained by the relevant company every year.</li>
<li>Once used, it must be refilled.</li>
<li>A "Not Used During Earthquake" sign should be hung on the doors of elevators in buildings.</li>

<ul>
<li>Make sure of your own safety first.</li>

</ul>
<h4><strong>IF YOU ARE IN AN OPEN AREA;</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Note the damage around you.</li>
